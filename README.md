# smd_macro
Define custom macros/virtual Textpattern tags for your site.

As of Textpattern 4.7.0, this plugin is _no longer required_ and should be considered retired. You can obtain similar and more powerful functionality from [Short-tags and shortcodes](https://docs.textpattern.io/tags/shortcodes/custom-short-tags-and-shortcodes) instead.
